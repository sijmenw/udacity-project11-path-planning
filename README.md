# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

# Code description
The code can be roughly split into four sections:
 1. determine if action is necessary
 2. generating trajectories
 3. calculating cost for each trajectory
 4. selecting trajectory

Each of the sections will be described below.

#1. 
Trajectory generation and following steps is only started if:
 - current remaining path is too short (main.cpp:366 trajecMin (60)).
 - not currently switching lanes or stabilizing (if a lane switch is started, it must be completed).
 The car is considered to be stabilizing for one iteration after arriving in the target lane.

Check for stabilizing can be found in main.cpp:412-419.

#2.
The trajectories are generated according to three possible decisions:
 - Switch left
 - Keep lane
 - Switch right
 
A switch will not be considered if doing so would result in driving off road.

For each decision, three trajectories are generated, one at 100% speed, one at 85% speed and one at 70% speed.
The speed that is referred to here is the maximum attainable speed, meaning without breaking the speed limit or the 
maximum acceleration parameters.

A margin is used to prevent small derivation from exceeding the threshold for acceleration or jerk.

The calculations for step sizes can be found in main.cpp:243-255.

For each trajectory the following steps are performed:
    
    Firstly, step sizes are determined. Speed is calculated to increase or decrease linearly to target speed over the trajectory.
    Step sized are stored.
    
    4 points are calculated to later determine the trajectory when no previous path exists.
     1. point in the 'past', using the heading and speed of the car, a point is calculated in the past using linear extrapolation
     2. current position of the car
     3. target point, using sum of speed step sizes calculated earlier, added along the s coordinate of the car, and the d value of the 
     center of the target lane. Then converted back to XY (world) coordinates.
     4. point in the future, using using s coordinate in the lane and speed of latest calculated speed step to
      calculate location 10 time steps after target point.
    
    When a previous path exists, the first 5 points from the previous path are taken instead of step 1 and 2.
    The 'current' position of the car in this case is set to be the tail of these previous path values.
    
    These points are converted to Car Coordinates and used to generate a spline.
    
    Using linear approximation and the calculated step sizes, XY (car) points on the spline are calculated.
    
    These points are then converted back to XY (world) coordinates.
    
    When a previous path was used, it is also the beginning of the new trajectory.

#3.
When the trajectories (max 9) are generated, the costs for each of them is calculated.
Penalties are assigned for:
 - attempting to switch lanes towards vehicle
 - driving close to vehicles
 - driving very close to vehicles
 - driving slow
 - switching lanes

By tuning the values associated with these costs, different driving behaviours can be attained.

The cost calculation function can be found in helper.h:29.

#4.
The trajectory with the lowest cost is selected and sent to the simulator.

### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
